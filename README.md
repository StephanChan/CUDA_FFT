# CUDA_FFT

these are a few examples that are doing FFT using CUDA+C code. The code export the functions into a DLL file, which can be called in any other non-C language such as LabVIEW.

To start with, please read the read_me.doc

The OCT_FFT_TEMPLATE folder is tested and can run successfully, also the code are nicely commmented. The other folders contains code for different perpurse, but were not tested to run successfully
